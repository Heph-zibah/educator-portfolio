    text: "I discovered Lucid English in 2023 when I was preparing for my IELTS exam through an unofficial source at my school. The lessons were top-notch—always timely, practical, and engaging, even though they were conducted online. Lucid English’s assignments and personal testing system helped me fully understand the exam, beyond just the lessons. Thanks to the quality of the classes, I've recommended Lucid English to friends, and even to my elder brother.",
